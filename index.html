            <h2>We train a LSTM-unit recurrent neural network to forecast upcoming tool wear by history</h2>
            <p>The network takes as input a time-series of historical tool wear, and outputs a time-series of
                future tool wear. The input and output time could be adjusted according to forecasting task(emergency ,short
                time or long time). The trainable parameters in this recurrent neural network is fewer and the model
                can train or run on both CPU-only and GPU-accelerate computing environment. It enables widespread usage in
                embedded system which is not good at computation.
            </p>
            <p>To cut computation cost of this fragile model, very ordinary methods are used. Since tool wear has fewer
                dimension, not much tricks are taken into use.

            <h2>Extend forecasting period by self-reference</h2>
            <p>When model's output time is not less than input one, the predicted tool wear could be seen as historical data
                to drive the same model for further tool wear. Since output is larger than input, the recursive process is unstoppable.
                After that, native forecasting time will be extended.
            </p>
            <p>However, there is no free lunch in this algorithm. Like snake eat itself, all poison loss will be accumulated then model dies.
                Eventually, result of self-reference won't longer be accurate. Even though, large-scale self-reference's result could indicates
                tool wear tendency in future.
            </p>
            <p>By that, it's easy for model to prolong its forecasting time while model can hold its accuracy. However, from short-time
                to long-time forecast model, ratio of self-reference could be so large that recursive algorithm's error is beyond imagination.
                Building a native model according to machining requirement is still the best choice.

            <h2>High-accurate upcoming tool wear forecast</h2>
            <p>The LSTM RNN model gets a outstanding performance at both train and dataset of PHM 2010 dataset.
                The MSE is lower than 1. It's indicates that a perfect upcoming tool wear will be given if a accurate
                tool wear is offered. According to latest technology, some optical method could help us get real-time
                tool wear. Implementing that will enable model appliance in real machining condition.

            <h2>Real-time correction by CNN to enhance forecasting value</h2>
            <p>As is said before, there aren't many machines equipped with optical system. Under that circumstances,
                no in-process tool wear is given. So another approach is in demand.
            </p>
            <p>We have developed a high-accurate monitoring model before. It's time for that model to provide productivity now.
                We could use signal to collect machining condition information and feed that model to predict current tool wear. After
                receiving predicted tool wear, it's easy to implement this forecasting technology into widespread use. Optical
                sensor is hard to equip while sensors needed in monitoring model is easy and cheap. So it offers a practical way to
                apply in real product.
            </p>
            <p>But there is a error in monitoring tool wear, its error will be passed to forecasting model and cause a considerable
                error in forecast result. The discrete point in forecast graph illustrates this error pass result. Luckily, since we can get multiple prediction before current condition, we can use historical
                forecasting value to correct nowadays data. So we maintain a forecast list recording historical forecast, and use median
                or average value as final decision. It could strongly impede discrete points and promote final forecast level.
            </p>
            <p>By considering stateful(RNN) and stateless(CNN) prediction, the final decision is rather accurate and follows the
                degradation rule. Because no time label implicitly or explicitly given, in degradation given by CNN model,
                tool wear decrease at some period. In order to avoid that stupid mistake, RNN could help promote final result with
                introducing time dependency relation.

            <h3>Given that more than 600 sample from PHM data, high-accuracy forecast by native RNN model can indicate
